# SnykCon 2021 Product Track: 
## _Automating Secure Container Workflows_

This is our hapless developer's super secret project - a soon to be world famous game they've been working on.

In the demo, we look specifically at the container components and choices and use Snyk to address issues. Note that Snyk can also address issues with the code and deployment configuration (Kubernetes, in this case), as well.


The original source for this game is the Node 8 multiplayer Snake game:
